            <h2>Hey There!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a software developer with a constant drive to learn and a passion for making people
                laugh. But that's oversimplifying things a bit, isn't it? Read on. <br>

                Most of my early twenties were spent writing music and building my band's following. By 2018, I had gone
                on a numerous tours and played sold out shows for thousands of people. In 2016 I helped open a local
                business staple alongside two of my close friends that is still thriving to this day. You're probably
                wondering what any of this has to do with software development or technology, right? Hang tight. <br>

                I've been on computers since I was very young. I can remember the sound of our dial up modem and my mom
                yelling for me free up the phone as if it were yesterday. But most of the time, the computer was nothing
                but a tool; a tool to play games, to write music, to connect with friends. Even when building my own PCs
                in the past, it was always a means to an end. <br>

                But something funny happened in my life; I became a father. The "dream" of being a touring musician no
                longer seemed all that appealing. So I was forced to examine myself, my goals, and my career. And I
                happened upon software development. Now I'll be honest, it wasn't something I ever expected to take a
                liking to. Nonetheless, I started picking people's brains about how they liked working "tech jobs".
                After some hesitation, I decided to dive right in and started learning Python via a course on Udemy.
                <br>

                I was hooked. The satisfaction I got from using my brain to solve problems and build applications was
                addicting. It's still addicting. Hours fly by like minutes when I'm coding. When I'm not in front of a
                computer, my brain is involuntarily working on solutions for whatever project is at hand. <br>

                So what was the point of all those unrelated aforementioned achievements? <br>

                It's to show you that when I'm passionate about something, I make it happen. It becomes a bit of an
                obsession, for better or for worse. Every waking minute, there is some part of my brain that is thinking
                about how to achieve what I've set out to do. And I am passionate about being a software developer.
